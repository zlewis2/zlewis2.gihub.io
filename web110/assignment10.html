    <h1> Activity: Adding Images, Audio, and Video to Websites. </h1>
    <p2>So in this assignment we learned how to add video, audio, and images to websites. I feel as if this
        is an extension to the last assignment where we are learning how to make out websites more personal
        and funcitonal with different types of media. This continues to expand on how we can increase the
        functionality of websites. Being able to add your own images to something just makes the creative
        potential so much higher. I can't wait to continue using these new tools.
