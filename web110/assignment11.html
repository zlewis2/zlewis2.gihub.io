    <p1>Hello world!</p1>
    <h1> Activity: Use WebAIM. </h1>
    <p2> So I plugged in the colors I am using in my CSS style page to the website "https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/". This website allows me to check to make sure I have proper contrast on my website
        so that people can properly read what I write. People with vision issues can find it hard to read certain text colors on certain colered backgrounds. So making sure all text is readable on what ever color background
        is important to be ascsessable to all types of people. I will remeber to use this website from here on out to make sure I am using proper colors. I learned that making sure that my website is ascsessable to others is 
        very important and an essential feature.

    <h2> Activity: Use Paletton </h2>
    <p3> Using this tool makes sure that all the colors I use on my website are asthetically nice and look good together. Being able to pick a primary color you like and then being given the complimentary colors automatically is very
        useful and would save a ton of time. I plan to use this on all future websites to make sure everything is looking good together and makes my website look more professional and well put together. I learned that you don't need an art
        degree to be able to put together a nice looking website with nice complimentary colors.
