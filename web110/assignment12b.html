    <p1>Hello world!</p1>
    <h1> Activity: Resume and LinkedIn Profile. </h1>
    <p2>
        So first I went and made a resume and added all my work experience, skills, and education experience.
        I made it in a text file, PDF, and picture. I then went to LinkedIn and started making my profile.
        I added all my work experience, education, volunteer work, skills, achivements, and also addded my resume to it.
        I connected with others I know and started networking. Having a resume is essential when trying to apply to jobs and
        having a LinkedIn page can give more detail about yourself that you can't fit in a one page resume. Also being able
        to connect to others in the work force can be essential to getting a job and making professional connections.
        I should have done both a while ago but I am super happy I did now and will make sure to continue to update both as time goes on.
