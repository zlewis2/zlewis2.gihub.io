    <p1>Hello world!</p1>
    <h1> Activity: Databases. </h1>
    <p2> So while doing this assignment I had to figure out all sorts of different data points connected to each other and how to gain information based
        off of all the different pieces of information. It was very fun and it felt like a sort of puzzle to figure out all the different questions. It was very
        tedious sometimes to get the different pieces of infortmation and I could easily see why programing something to do that for us would be much more effecient.
        I had a ton of fun figuring out all the different questions and helped me understand databases more.
