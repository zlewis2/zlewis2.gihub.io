    <p1>Hello world!</p1>
    <h1> Activity: SQL. </h1>
    <p2> In this assingment I learned what some SQL statements might look like once starting to use them. I learned about the basics of SQL and database management.
        Being able to use code to search and parse a database can be super usefull. Also having a website to display those querries is also awesome. Once we actually impliment
        a database to use this code to work on we can start to really understand how to use this to parse datasets.
