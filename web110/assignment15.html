    <p1>Hello world!</p1>
    <h1> Activity: Project Management  </h1>
    <p2> I chose to do my final project on the topic of IT Careers. I plan on explaining all the different types of jobs in the field and how they corralate towards each other.
      I will also go into some of the requirements for these possitions, pay, experience needed, etc. I will show some statistics on how I think that this field will keep growing 
      and how we will need more and more people to go into this field. I will use graphics and speach to convay my point properly. Using the gantt chart helps me stay focused and on track
      in order to complete this assignment.
