    <p1>Hello world!</p1>
    <h1> Activity: Use Different Web Browsers </h1>
    <p2> I used edge and chrome to see the differences between the two. From what I know and could tell they both use the free open
        souce software called chromium as the base of their web browsers. So this makes the functionality of both of them very similar.
        Of course chrome has more integrations with google products such as Google accounts, Gmail, and G Suite. Edge has more microsoft
        integrations. </p2>
    <h2> Activity: Look at different browser extensions</h2>
    <p3> So I used chromium extensions and found quite a few great ones. One of the first ones I used was a passowrd manager extension
        that helped me keep track of all my passwords. I also used an extension called grammarly which helped me correct my spelling and
        grammar better than the built in spell checker would have.
