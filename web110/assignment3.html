    <p1>Hello world!</p1>
    <h1> Activity: Use Different Search Engines </h1>
    <p2> After using Google, Bing, Ask, and Yahoo as search engines I found that the actual search results from them are very similar.
    The UI on the otherhand is quite different between them. I would say that Bing and Google are quite similar with their design with being 
    more clean and simple while Ask and Yahoo are more cluttered and busy with news and tabloid articles taking up a lot of space.
    Google by far has the most market share at around 92%, Bing at 4%, Yahoo at 1% and Ask being well bellow 1%.
    I learned that Google has a very strong market hold compared to all other search engines. Also that Bing is taking a very similar aproach to google
    in order to try to gain more market share. I now personally use Bing since I use edge and by using both you can get rewards points from microsoft
    that you can use to get gift cards and other prizes.</p2>
    <h2> Activity: Use the Way Back Machine</h2>
    <p3> I spend a couple of hours using the wayback machine and using it to see how certain websites looked like in the past. This exerience was honestly really
    cool and intersting to look at. I think the preservation of history is super important and with the internet being so volitle and ever changing its very hard
    to capture important points in history for the internet. The wayback machine provides a way to do just that and allows for people to self submit this as well.
    Being able to go back in time and look at how the internet developed is huge for people to look back on. Its also not very hard to submit any website you want which
    is great for people to help the cause and keeping history of the internet. I will personally be using this site to preserve important things and websites I see that 
    I want to make sure people can go back and see and remember.
