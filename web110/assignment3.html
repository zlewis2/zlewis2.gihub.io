    <p1>Hello world!</p1>
    <h1> Activity: Use Different Web Browsers </h1>
    <p2> I used edge and chrome to see the differences between the two. From what I know and could tell they both use the free open
        souce software called chromium as the base of their web browsers. So this makes the functionality of both of them very similar.
        Of course chrome has more integrations with google products such as Google accounts, Gmail, and G Suite. Edge has more microsoft
        integrations. I have learned that both google chrome and edge have the same core and so therefor function very similarly.
        I now use edge over chrome due to the info I learned while doing this task and enjoy its features more than chrome.</p2>
    <h2> Activity: Look at different browser extensions</h2>
    <p3> So I used chromium extensions and found quite a few great ones. One of the first ones I used was a passowrd manager extension
        that helped me keep track of all my passwords. I also used an extension called grammarly which helped me correct my spelling and
        grammar better than the built in spell checker would have. I learned alot more about the different types of extentions that can be
        used across both edge and chrome and getting use out of them.
