    <p1>Hello world!</p1>
    <h1> Activity: Send, receive, and respond to email </h1>
    <p2> Using Gmail as my main email provider, I went and sent emails, recived emails, and replied to emails. Doing this I learned a few things that will help me
        going into the future and the present. Email is a great way to communicate with almost anyone since it is a very common and universal way that people commiunicate.
        Also its very easy to understand and follows the same ideas that traditional mail uses, such as a sender and a reciver. Using email will be a great way to communicate
        with people and be productive. I can see myself using email now and into the furute for many of my communication needs.

    <h2> Activity: Use Internet mailing lists</h2>
    <p3> Internet mailing lists are things that you usually signup for when you create an account on some website and they will add you to their mailing list so that they
        can send you consistant emails about their products, updates, or anything they want you to know about. Not all mailing lists are connected to comapanys and some of them are
        list of articles or information that someone would be interested. But they can also be used for harm in order to target a specific demographic and try to take advantage of them
        with misleading ads or links that can scam people. So there are good and bad things with it and they should be something to be aware of. I already use certain mailing lists in order
        to get information about certain things I enjoy but I make sure to unsubscribe from certain mailing lists that I don't want to see.
