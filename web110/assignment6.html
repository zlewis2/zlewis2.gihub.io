    <p1>Hello world!</p1>
    <h1> Activity: Review IP address settings for your local network </h1>
    <p2> Learning about networking and IP adresses was very interesting. Using "Ipconfig" in the terminal was super cool in that it showed a bunch of information on my current network connection.
          While all the information was cool what was really helpful was the different types of troubleshooting and tools you can use to fix internet connection issues. Allowing to flush the DNS,
          reset ip-adresses, and seeing if you are even connected to the internet can be super useful in the future for troubleshooting any internet issues I have in the future.

    <h2> Activity: Verify Internet connectivity</h2>
    <p3> This activity kind of takes the previous activity but advances on it a lot. This takes the amount of information you are able to see to a whole different level. Being able to see the path
          your network traffic takes to get to the destiniation is super cool. Being able to visually take a look using tracert is super cool and amazing to look at. It also has a practical use as well.
          If you are having internet connection issues, being able to see where along the network path its getting stuck can help troubleshoot some issues you might be having and could help solve in issue.
          Using the "ping" command can also help alot with troubleshooting. Using all these tools can be super usefull to fix any internet issues one might be having.
