    <p1>Hello world!</p1>
    <h1> Activity: Research password managers and multi-factor authentication. </h1>
    <p2> After checking out some password managers I decided on bitwarden. Bitwarden is free to use and can sync your logins across multiple devices.
     It also works on PC as well as mobile which makes it easy to make sure everything is synced together. It makes my password security better since I don't remember any of
     my password and the only password I have to remeber is a very long and secure one to my password manager. Learning how to use a password manager has made me more secure and
     made it easier to keep track of all my different passwords across all of my accounts. I will certainly teach others how to use them as they are super helpful.

    <h2> Activity: Practice web browser safety</h2>
    <p3> I went through all the steps listed and found out many intersting things. Looking through my settings helped me find different ways to make sure less of my information was
        being so easily accsessed. Deleting cookies and autoform information from different sites helped make sure that they had less data on me. Using the incognito tab does that automaticaly
        on all websites which can be helpfull for some websites but not so much for others. Also learning how to look at the website certificate is super helpful in making sure a website is legitamate.
        Overall these tools can help me stay more secure and have a better idea of what kind of data is going out on the internet.
