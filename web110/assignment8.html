    <p1>Hello world!</p1>
    <h1> Activity: HTML Index Page List. </h1>
    <p2>So while making this website and mainly the new index page it remminded me of how websites used be when the internet was first becomming a thing
      The very plain design with the classic blue hyperlink text that took you from page to page. It reminded me that in order to have functionality you dont
      need a bunch of fancy design and all you need is simple html code that allows you to go from page to page. This being so simple can allow someone, almost anyone,
      to make their own website with even very basic functionality. It makes me inspired to make my own websites in my freetime.
