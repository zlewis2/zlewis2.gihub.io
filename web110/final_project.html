    <p1>Hello world!</p1>
    <h1> Activity: Final Project. </h1>
    <p2> I learned a lot about the internet and web development through out this course. I learned a ton about how to build a website and customize it to my own will. I learned about different IT possitions and jobs. I learned about how the internet works as a whole and all the stuff that goes into it. 
      It has been super fun and will lead me down a career in IT and web development. References: Galarita, B. (2024, March 5). Top information technology careers: Salaries, degrees and job growth. Forbes. https://www.forbes.com/advisor/education/careers-in-information-technology/
